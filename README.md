# The Problem

Since Covid-19 hit the world and countries are doing everything to stop the spreading, it happened that a lot of people stay at home.
Because being alone is against the human urge to socialise, the amount of users using Discord and similar plattforms has risen, to satisfy these needs.

Now to the Jackbox games. Jackbox games or the Jackbox Party Packs are offering different minigames to play together. The clue: Only one person has to own the game and the other ones can participate through the website "jackbox.tv". Therefore this game fits perfectly to play with others on discord servers, because only one person has to stream the main game, while the others just have to join through the website.

But sometimes it happens that your friends aren't online or you just don't know enough of the other people on a server to play with them.
This Discord bot is trying to help with this problem. 

# Description

The bot offers the functionality to create a matchmaking queue. If you want to play a game you can create a queue, other people can subscribe to or you can 
just subscribe to existing ones. Once a queue has enough player you'll get a discord notification, that enough players have arrived. The bot itself also offers a couple of
roles, that will determinate if at least one person in the queue owns one of the jackbox games and if so , which ones. This will protect people from joining a queue without anyone even owning the game.
Another functionality of the bot will be, that it will create a new voicechannel, if there are not enough free channels left on the server.
