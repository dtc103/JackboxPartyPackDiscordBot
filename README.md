# Description

Since Covid-19 hit the world and countries are doing everything to stop the spreading, it happened that a lot of people stay at home.
Because being alone is against the human urge to socialise, the amount of users using Discord and similar plattforms has risen, to satisfy these needs.

Now to the Jackbox games. Jackbox games or the Jackbox Party Packs are offering different minigames to play together. The clue: Only one person has to own the game and the other ones can participate through the website "jackbox.tv". Therefore this game fits perfectly to play with others on discord servers, because only one person has to stream the main game, while the others just have to join through the website.
